# INBOX -- Track Features/Things to note down

## Inbox -- Collect whatever stuff

## OKR -- The Objective Keys and Results

Monthly ammended. With all its history.

## Don't Do

Anything not meeting the current OKR. You may repeatedly come up with the same idea once in a long period, with the same time-wasting procedures to deal with it. So the best solution is just to write it down as a notice.

## Maybe Later

Tasks that are not to be started immediately.

## Can Do

Tasks that can be started by the end of next week. Every week I will check this section and move some tasks into todo.md.
