# INBOX -- Track Features/Things to note down

## Inbox -- Collect whatever stuff

- **Authentication flow**:
    - Header component will fetch user details from token, and if that does not work, will redirect us to signin page.
    - Login Page will first check if metamask is installed or not. And will login with metamask.
    - If login does not happen, then signup is the last option.
- **Metamask Connect**:
    - We will have the metamask connect function in most of the pages except the home page.
    - We will log the user in and show his/her details, but will only prompt for metamask connect required, if some transactions needs to be done and metamask is not connected.

## OKR -- The Objective Keys and Results

Monthly ammended. With all its history.

## Don't Do

Anything not meeting the current OKR. You may repeatedly come up with the same idea once in a long period, with the same time-wasting procedures to deal with it. So the best solution is just to write it down as a notice.

## Maybe Later

Tasks that are not to be started immediately.

## Can Do

Tasks that can be started by the end of next week. Every week I will check this section and move some tasks into todo.md.
